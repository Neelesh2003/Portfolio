Got it! Here's a **README.md** file for your portfolio website project that uses **HTML, CSS, JS**, and **EmailJS**.

# My Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This website is a showcase of my skills, projects, and experiences. It is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for the frontend, with **EmailJS** integrated to send messages from the contact form directly to my email.

## 🚀 Features

- 🖥️ A personal introduction, showcasing my skills and experiences
- 📊 Detailed project sections to highlight my work
- 📱 Fully responsive design that works on all screen sizes
- 🖋️ Clean and modern UI with custom CSS
- 📞 Contact form section integrated with **EmailJS** to send messages directly to my email

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before running the website locally, you will need the following:

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- **EmailJS** account to send emails from the contact form (sign up at [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/))

## 📥 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-portfolio.git
```

### 2. Open the project folder

Navigate to the project folder on your computer:

```bash
cd my-portfolio
```

### 3. Open in a browser

Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser:

```bash
index.html
```

This will launch your portfolio website locally.

## ✍️ Contact Form Integration with EmailJS

To enable the contact form to send messages to your email, follow these steps:

### 1. Create an EmailJS account

Go to [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) and sign up for an account.

### 2. Get your service ID and template ID

- In the EmailJS dashboard, create an email service.
- Set up an email template for the contact form (you can use the default template or customize it).
- Get your **Service ID** and **Template ID** from the EmailJS dashboard.

### 3. Add your keys to the JavaScript file

In the JavaScript file (`main.js`), replace the `service_XXXXX` and `template_XXXXX` placeholders with your actual EmailJS **Service ID** and **Template ID**:

```javascript
emailjs.sendForm('your_service_id', 'your_template_id', this)
```

### 4. Customize the email template

Make sure the email template has placeholders that match the fields in the contact form (e.g., `name`, `email`, `subject`, and `message`).

### 5. Test the contact form

Once you've integrated the keys and template, try submitting the contact form. If everything is set up correctly, the form will send your message to your email.

## 💡 Folder Structure

The project structure is as follows:

```bash
my-portfolio/
│
├── index.html                 # Main HTML file (landing page)
├── styles.css                 # Custom CSS file for styling
├── main.js                    # JavaScript file to handle form submission and EmailJS
├── assets/                    # Folder for images and other static assets
└── README.md                  # This file
```

## 🎨 Custom Styling with CSS

The website uses custom CSS to create a modern and clean look. Tailoring the design to your needs is easy — you can modify the `styles.css` file for styling adjustments.

### Key Notes:
- **EmailJS** is integrated to send the form data to your email. You must sign up for an EmailJS account, configure the service and template in their dashboard, and add the **service ID** and **template ID** to the JavaScript file (`main.js`).
- The folder structure is simple and straightforward with HTML, CSS, and JS files in place.
- The **Getting Started** section guides the user on how to clone the repo and open the portfolio locally.

### Customization:
- Replace the `yourusername/my-portfolio.git` with your actual GitHub repository URL.
- Ensure that the **Service ID** and **Template ID** are correctly configured in the JavaScript file.
